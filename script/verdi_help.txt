[Simulator Options]

DESCRIPTION
    All simulator options are accepted by Verdi. For a complete
    list, refer to the manual for your simulator. The following list
    are commonly used with Verilog:

OPTIONS
    -dumpUnfinishedTrans
                  When this option is specified, the following FSDB
                  options will be automatically appended when the
                  Verdi platform starts the simv binary.
                  
                  +fsdb+event_dump_unfinished.

    -i            Run the simulator.

    -simBin "<Path>"
                  Specify the path of the simulation binary file.
                  The path must be double quoted.

    -simOpt 'option1 option2 ... optionN' 
                  Specify simulation options. A pair of single
                  quotes (') must be used to enclose the options.

    -simType <VCS|ModelSim|NC>
                  Specify the simulator (VCS or ModelSim or NC) to
                  use.

    -uvmDebug     When this option is specified and "VCS" is
                  specified as the simulator type, the following VCS
                  run-time options will be automatically appended
                  when the Verdi platform starts the simv binary.
                  
                  +UVM_CONFIG_DB_TRACE
                  +UVM_PHASE_TRACE

[Behavior Analysis Options]

OPTIONS
    -apimem <file name>
                  Specify a file to define API memory.

    -ba           Perform behavior analysis immediately after load
                  design. If -ba is specified with -bdb_load, -ba
                  will be ignored.

    -ba_mode [WSBA|MBBA]
                  WSBA: Perform non-incremental behavior analysis in
                  working scope mode.
                  MBBA: Perform incremental behavior analysis in
                  module-based mode.

    -bas "scope(s)" | "*"
                  Perform Behavior Analysis with the given scope as
                  working scope(s) immediately after loading the
                  design. For example, -bas "{scope1} {scope2}" will
                  take "scope1" and "scope2" as working scopes and
                  -bas "{*}" will take every loaded top module as
                  working scopes.

    -bboxEmptyModule [0|1]
                  0: Not to define the empty modules as black
                  boxes.
                  1: Define the empty modules as black boxes.

    -bboxModuleFile <file name>
                  Define the modules in the specified file as black
                  boxes.

    -bboxSysTaskFile <file name>

                  boxes.

    -bdb_incr     Load the Behavior Database (BDB) incrementally.
                  This option only works when the -bdb_load option
                  is specified.
                  For example, 
                  > novas -lib work -top system -bdb_load
                    work.lib++/work.bdb -bdb_incr.

    -bdb_load [filename]
                  Load Behavior Database (BDB) immediately after
                  loading the design from library. If -bdb_load is
                  specified with -ba, -ba will be ignored.
                  
                  If a file name is specified without a full path,
                  the default path specified in the [turbo_library]
                  section of the novas.rc file will be used. For
                  example:
                    [turbo_library]
                    bacom=<the library path>
                  If the novas.rc is not specified, the default will
                  be "work.lib++".
                  
                  If the file name is not specified, the default
                  option value is"<lib_path>/work.bdb" where
                  <lib_path> is the path specified in .rc file if
                  specified; work.lib++ otherwise.

    -bdb_load_scope "pathName"
                  Specify the path to load the top module of the
                  Behavior Database (BDB) file. This option only
                  works when the -bdb_load option is specified.
                  For example, 
                  > novas -lib work -top system -bdb_load
                    work.lib++/work.bdb -bdb_load_scope
                    "system.i_cpu".

    -cellModel [0|1|2|3|4]
                  0: Use the cells from the symbol library first.
                  1: Use the cells only from the symbol library.
                  2: Use the cells only from the simulation
                  library.
                  3: Use the cells from the simulation library
                  first.
                  4: For combinational cells, the Behavior Analysis
                  engine will use the simulation model first and for
                  sequential cells, the Behavior Analysis engine
                  will use the symbol library model first.

    -clockSkew [0|positive integer]
                  Specify the worst-case clock skew.

    -cont_ba_err  
                  Continue performing behavior analysis even when
                  errors occur from importing the design.

    -loopUnroll [0|positive integer]
                  Define any for loops with a number greater than
                  the specified value as black boxes.

                  simulation library.

                  Use the specified cell(s) from the symbol library.

    -symLibCellExceptionListFile <file name>

                  unresolved module instances were found, 2. search
                  through the rest of the libraries, 3. search again
                  from the first library.

    +librescan    Search for the module definitions of unresolved
                  module instances by always starting from the first

    +libverbose   
                  Print a message in the compiler.log file to
                  indicate the library file where the instance is

                  source file or library files.
                  NOTE: This option does not take effect when

                  in the release package or in an absolute path. 
                  For example, 
                  > verdi +pkgdir+amba <design> ...
                    -> Compile the amba.f package located in the
                  default product directory.
                    -> Default product directory:
                  "<NOVAS_INST_DIR>/etc/kdb/verilog/dwvip/AMBA_PKG"

    commonly used.

OPTIONS
    -aoSignalFile file
                  Specify the input file where full hierarchy names
                  of always-on signals are listed.

    -cpf | -cpf1.0 | -cpf1.1 | -cpf2.0 filename
                  Specify the version of CPF file(s) to import.

    -domainColor configFile
                  Specify the configuration file to set colors of
                  the specified power domains.

    -extractSamePort
                  When a power design is imported from the command
                  line and this option is specified, the power
                  domain state is evaluated considering
                  add_port_state command(s) for the same port alias.
                  This option is only valid for UPF designs.

    -lp_xml file  
                  Specify the name of the low-power XML file to
                  import. The low-power XML file is generated by
                  simulators like VCS.

    -lps_cpf cpf_filename
                  Specify the name of the CPF file to be used with
                  the design.

                  auto_complete: Support automatic completion of UPF
                  commands. By default, the automatic completion for
                  UPF commands and command options is disabled. It
                  is recommended to correct the UPF command or
                  command option instead of using
                  -power=auto_complete.

                  = 1 is considered ON for ground; 0|no = 0 is
                  considered ON for ground. This option is only
                  valid for UPF designs.
